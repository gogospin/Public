The code assumes that the user has pulseq-master directory under drive I.
The files and folders from the directory SpiralASL_with_Pulseq are placed under I:\pulseq-master\matlab
For different localized settings please make changes accordingly in
ASL_FAIRQUIPSSII_spiral_sosp_invivo.m, to the variable buildpath and workpath


The code has been tested to work on Matlab R2020a
Current it is under further improvement for being more user-friendly.
